  Text: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) display substantial cell-to-cell variation. This heterogeneity manifests among donors, among tissue sources, and within cell populations. Such pervasive variability complicates the use of MSCs in regenerative applications and may limit their therapeutic efficacy. Most conventional assays measure MSC properties in bulk and, as a consequence, mask this cell-to-cell variation. Recent studies have identified extensive variability amongst and within clonal MSC population...

Targeting dNTP pool sanitizing enzymes, such as MTH1, is a highly promising anticancer strategy. The MTH2 protein, known as NUDT15, is described as the second human homologue of bacterial MutT with 8-oxo-dGTPase activity. We present the first NUDT15 crystal structure and demonstrate that NUDT15 prefers other nucleotide substrates over 8-oxo-dGTP. Key struct...

  Title: ADAR1 Forms a Complex with Dicer to Promote MicroRNA Processing and RNA-Induced Gene Silencing
  Text: Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) are involved in RNA editing that converts adenosine residues to inosine specifically in double-stranded RNAs. In this study, we investigated the interaction of the RNA editing mechanism with the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery and found that ADAR1 forms a complex with Dicer through direct protein-protein interaction. Most importantly, ADAR1 increases the maximum rate (Vmax) of pre-microRNA (miRNA) cleavage by Dicer and facilitates loading of miRNA ont...

  Title: Exome sequencing identifies somatic gain-of-function PPM1D mutations in brainstem gliomas
  Text: Gliomas arising in the brainstem and thalamus are devastating tumors that are difficult to surgically resect. To determine the genetic and epigenetic landscape of these tumors, we performed exomic sequencing of 14 brainstem gliomas (BSGs) and 12 thalamic gliomas. We also performed targeted mutational analysis of an additional 24 such tumors and genome-wide methylation profiling of 45 gliomas. This study led to the discovery of tumor-specific mutations in PPM1D, encoding wild-type p53-induced pro...

  Title: Deubiquitination of p53 by HAUSP is an important pathway for p53 stabilization
  Text: The p53 tumour suppressor is a short-lived protein that is maintained at low levels in normal cells by Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis. Stabilization of p53 is crucial for its tumour suppressor function. However, the precise mechanism by which ubiquitinated p53 levels are regulated in vivo is not completely understood. By mass spectrometry of affinity-purified p53-associated factors, we have identified herpesvirus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease (HAUSP) as a novel ...

Several forms of DNA damage have been shown to activate p53, including those generated by ionising radiation (IR), radio-mimetic drugs, ultraviolet light (UV) and chemicals such as methyl methane sulfonate (MMS). Under normal conditions, p53 levels are maintained at a low state by virtue of the extremely short-half life of the polypeptide. In addition to this, p53 n...

  Text: Stem cells persist throughout life in diverse tissues by undergoing self-renewing divisions. Self-renewal capacity declines with age, partly because of increasing expression of the tumor suppressor p16(Ink4a). We discovered that the Hmga2 transcriptional regulator is highly expressed in fetal neural stem cells but that expression declines with age. This decrease is partly caused by the increasing expression of let-7b microRNA, which is known to target HMGA2. Hmga2-deficient mice show reduced ste...

  Text: Antigen targeting and adjuvancy schemes that respectively facilitate delivery of antigen to dendritic cells and elicit their activation have been explored in vaccine development. Here we investigate whether nanoparticles can be used as a vaccine platform by targeting lymph node–residing dendritic cells via interstitial flow and activating these cells by in situ complement activation. After intradermal injection, interstitial flow transported ultra-small nanoparticles (25 nm) highly efficiently i...

  Text: The therapeutic efficacy of anticancer chemotherapies may depend on dendritic cells (DCs), which present antigens from dying cancer cells to prime tumor-specific interferon-γ (IFN-γ)–producing T lymphocytes. Here we show that dying tumor cells release ATP, which then acts on P2X7 purinergic receptors from DCs and triggers the NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing-3 protein (NLRP3)-dependent caspase-1 activation complex ('inflammasome'), allowing for the secretion of interleukin-1β (I...

Some studies suggest a dominant role for EGFR, a notion of renewed interest given the development of dual HER2/EGFR small-molecule inhibitors. Other studies point to HER3 as the primary coreceptor. To clarify the relative contributions of EGFR and HER3 to HER2 signaling, we studied receptor knockdown via small interfe...

  Text: Although it is well established that cAMP inhibits platelet activation induced by all agonists, the thromboxane A(2) signal transduction pathway was found to be particularly sensitive to such inhibition. Therefore, we examined whether cAMP-dependent kinase mediates phosphorylation of the thromboxane A(2) receptor-G-protein complex. It was found that cAMP induces protein kinase A-dependent [gamma-(32)P]ATP labeling of solubilized membrane proteins in the region of Galpha subunits, i.e. 38-45 kDa....

  Title: Molecular mechanisms of ribosomal protein gene coregulation.
  Text: The 137 ribosomal protein genes (RPGs) of Saccharomyces provide a model for gene coregulation. We examined the positional and functional organization of their regulators (Rap1 [repressor activator protein 1], Fhl1, Ifh1, Sfp1, and Hmo1), the transcription machinery (TFIIB, TFIID, and RNA polymerase II), and chromatin at near-base-pair resolution using ChIP-exo, as RPGs are coordinately reprogrammed. Where Hmo1 is enriched, Fhl1, Ifh1, Sfp1, and Hmo1 cross-linked broadly to promoter DNA in an RPG...

  Title: Displacement of a DNA binding protein by Dda helicase
  Text: Bacteriophage T4 Dda helicase has recently been shown to be active as a monomer for unwinding of short duplex oligonucleotides and for displacing streptavidin from 3′-biotinylated oligonucleotides. However, its activity for streptavidin displacement and DNA unwinding has been shown to increase as the number of Dda molecules bound to the substrate molecule increases. A substrate was designed to address the ability of Dda to displace DNA binding proteins. A DNA binding site for the Escherichia col...

  Title: Similar activation of signal transduction pathways by the herpesvirus-encoded chemokine receptors US28 and ORF74.
  Text: The virally encoded chemokine receptors US28 from human cytomegalovirus and ORF74 from human herpesvirus 8 are both constitutively active. We show that both receptors constitutively activate the transcription factors nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and that both pathways are modulated by their respective endogenous receptor ligands. By addition of specific pathway modulators against the G protein subunit Galphai, phospholipase C, protei...

  Title: Genomewide Analysis of PRC1 and PRC2 Occupancy Identifies Two Classes of Bivalent Domains
  Text: In embryonic stem (ES) cells, bivalent chromatin domains with overlapping repressive (H3 lysine 27 tri-methylation) and activating (H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation) histone modifications mark the promoters of more than 2,000 genes. To gain insight into the structure and function of bivalent domains, we mapped key histone modifications and subunits of Polycomb-repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2) genomewide in human and mouse ES cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation, followed by ultra high-t...
